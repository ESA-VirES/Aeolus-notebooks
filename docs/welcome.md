# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hello! Welcome to **Aeolus Notebooks** - a community resource to help people make use of the product portfolio from [**ESA's Aeolus mission**](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/aeolus) using the Python ecosystem. Here you will find recipes and guidance in using Aeolus data in conjunction with the [**VirES**](https://aeolus.services) data retrieval system and the [**Virtual Research Environment (VRE)**](https://vre.aeolus.services).


## How to use this resource

Some of these pages are generated from Jupyter notebooks which can be interacted with on the VRE - on those pages you will see a ðŸš€ rocket button at the top. Hover over that button and select *JupyterHub* to launch the notebook interactively (after first creating a free account). The notebooks are also available within the VRE already, baked into the notebook launcher.

:::{admonition} To give feedback (questions, suggestions, anything!) to help us improve:
:class: tip
- Using [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/): select text anywhere on these pages to annotate them publicly  
  (you need to create an account with Hypothesis to do this)
- Using GitHub:
    - [Open an Issue](https://github.com/ESA-VirES/Aeolus-notebooks/issues/) if you find an error or you have a specific suggestion
- If you have problems with your VirES account or for other inquiries, please email [info@vires.services](mailto:info@vires.services)
